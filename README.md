# C - WeMakeSoftware 
 
Well, C is a pretty flexible language, but nobody controls how we write and use it. 
But if others need to read the code, there must be a standard, right? 
Hmm, I’m not sure. If we are pros, then why make a strict design on how to write it? 
As long as it can be read, do we really need to make rules on how to write or how we build? 
Okay, I’m not big on writing documentation, but we can make a story. 
But the story in programming changes with each step. 
So the story needs a system, not just the code itself. 
 
We need to combine the story with true data standards, laws, rules, and hardware. Manufacturers have done a great job. 
We are all different users behind the screen. Everything we see is a timer and action when to do what and show the story as an image to the person who reads it. 
A story needs a title, but for real, I don’t want to inform the title. Whoever made the story, you can check we-make-software.com to see who joined the story. You can also join the story. 
 
But to make this code work for everyone we need to settle on some ground rules. The ground rules include the project name in the documentation and function names. We don’t use names like a b c d e f g or random letters. 
We need a story and it needs a beginning. After all Microsoft is a really closed environment we can’t do so much there only user-end things. But in Linux we can work in the kernel and focus on speed which is important. 
We can follow the rules Linux has and build a story. 
 
If we think about code the problem is jumping between code. Well that is a big problem because everything is read from top to bottom, but can we make this in the kernel? Yes, we can make it. 
But to manage that we need to set up a start and an end. 
But that is really a signal. This signal needs to be sent from the last project, else we can’t make a project in between. 
 
So the first project needs to send a signal to the project that starts. We can call the first project System. Linux has made EXPORT_SYMBOL. Well, as I say, code is read from top to bottom, so if we place EXPORT_SYMBOL at the bottom, then the projects in between can’t use it. 
So the point is, before coding, we need to decide how we work with this so projects can cross and we can jump in the story. We can attempt as many possible ways to place a title and reuse functions in each story. 
Let’s begin by making a project called System and Run. 

Let’s start with the run. The more you read, the more you will forget about the run. It happens to everyone. 
Let’s make the system remember the run or more like let the system remember Run.h 
What is this .h? It’s a header file, a helper. 
Not everything needs to be remembered, but like Linux, they have a standard way to start. They need MODULE_DESCRIPTION, MODULE_LICENSE, MODULE_AUTHOR, __init, __exit, module_init, and module_exit. 
 
 
But remember we need to use headers a lot, so let’s learn about headers.
When we include a header, we can use the language macros for the compiler so we don’t add the same code all the time.
By using # we enter the macro code. It’s pretty good to know because it can make future code easier to write.
Macro code is only for the compiler.


When we talk about avoiding using the same header, that part is hard to control. But if we follow some simple header rules, then it is no longer hard to understand.

How well can we use `ifndef` and what can it do? It means if we did not define it, then it will run the code, but if it is defined, then it will not run.

So basically, if we write:
 ```c 
#ifndef Run_h
#define Run_h
// any code we can have for the header
#endif
 ```

What it does is it will only run all the code inside once, as you can see in the comment. It will only be used one time and not double.

Now you understand why we use this wrapper in each header. Bravo! Next step.

Wait a minute, did you see a new word like `define`? This is where we can define some code that we can use for the C code and macro code. We can define a name. A define in a macro does not need a value all the time. We just define it, but we can also place a value. Then the code can look something like this:

```c
#ifndef Run_h
#define Run_h
#include <linux/module.h>
#include <linux/kernel.h>
#include <linux/init.h>

#define Void static void

#define Run(description)\
 MODULE_DESCRIPTION(#description);\
 MODULE_LICENSE("GPL");\
 MODULE_AUTHOR("We-Make-Software.Com");\
 static int __init RunInit(void){\
  DefaultStart();\
  return 0;\
 }\
 static void __exit RunExit(void){\
  DefaultEnd();\
 }\
 module_init(RunInit);\
 module_exit(RunExit)

#endif
```
